The unoccupied Residential Care home, which closed in 2018 is made up of a central two storey L-shaped central block with a single storey block to the front with a sheltered courtyard to the rear that connects the two ends of the central L shaped block.

The single storey structure to the west houses the main entrance of the building along with a commercial kitchen and other ancillary facilities that supported the buildingâ€™s former function as a care home. The rest of the building is made up of a series of bedrooms, bathrooms and small function rooms across the two storey central and East wings.
