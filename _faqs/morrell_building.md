The unoccupied Residential Care home, which closed in 2018 is of masonry construction and consists of a central two storey L-shaped central block with a single storey, enclosed and glazed linking structure to the North East that creates a sheltered courtyard- the glazed corridor link connects the two ends of the central L shaped block. There is another single storey flat roof wing to the West of the site.

The single storey structure to the west houses the main entrance of the building along with a commercial kitchen and other ancillary facilities that supported the buildingâ€™s former function as a care home. The rest of the building is made up of a series of bedrooms, bathrooms and small function rooms across the two storey central and East wings.

There is also a basement underneath the north end of the two-storey central block which houses services equipment and provides ventilation underneath the suspended floors, which houses incoming utilities, heating and hot water infrastructure and power for the whole building.
