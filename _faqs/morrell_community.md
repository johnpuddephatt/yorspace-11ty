There has been a regular schedule of formal and informal community involvement to aid the development of the design proposals and helped raise awareness of the project, which started in October 2021 during York Design Week that was led by OpHouse and Sheffield University students as part of the Live Projects module. Since then the Project Delivery team has run a series of design workshops and outreach activities that have been run at Morrell House or in the surrounding Burton Green area.
