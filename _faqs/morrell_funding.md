The partner organisations made a successful application to the Community Housing Fund for Revenue funding to develop a full planning application and a project business case as well as nurture and establish the future resident Housing Co-op. This was awarded in December 2021 and has helped fund the formation of a Project Delivery team. The funding has allowed this Team to carry out a thorough assessment of the suitability and feasibility of redeveloping the land and buildings, which has been supported by a series of surveys and reports and through community involvement.
