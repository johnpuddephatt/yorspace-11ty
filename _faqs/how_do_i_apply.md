If you're interested in finding out more about a YorSpace development, then why not [become a YorSpace member](/join), it costs Â£2 and allows you to join our residents' register. YorSpace will notify you when allocations are open for a new home with one of our partner Co-operatives.

Alternatively if you're specifically interested in joining Lowfield Green Housing Co-op then you can reach out and sign up to their mailing list via their website [here](https://lowfieldgreencoop.uk/contact/).
