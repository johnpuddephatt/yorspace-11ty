The site is located at Morrell House, to the north of York city centre in Clifton. The site comprises a vacant residential care home for up to 29 older people, which closed in 2018 and was previously operated by CYC, understood to have specialised in care for older people with dementia. The site is bound by apartments to the north (Mawdin House) and Bootham Stray (open space) to the east. Residential apartments (Magdalene and Meeks House) form the southern boundary, with Burton Stone Lane forming the western boundary.

There is vehicular access taken from the southern boundary of the site via an existing access via Burton Stone Lane, which serves the main existing car park with circa 8 spaces. The site access is shared with the existing apartment buildings to the south of the site (Magdalene House and Meeks House). There is also an additional access provided to the north of the site which accommodates access to a smaller car park for the site, with circa 3 spaces, as well being shared access with the existing Mawdlin House apartment building.

There are 8 secure and sheltered cycle parking spaces available at the existing site (4 stands accommodating 2 bicycles each), provided in the southern car park via Burton Stone Lane on the southern boundary of the site.
