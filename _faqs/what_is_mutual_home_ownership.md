Mutual Home Ownership (MHO) is a new form of home ownership with affordability at its heart.

People living in MHO properties pay a deposit and make monthly payments under the terms of a long lease. In making payments, they accrue collective ownership of a cooperative society.

Ownership is long-term and secure. If a resident wishes to leave, their lease and occupancy rights are transferred to a new incoming member, and their accrued equity in the society is returned to them.

By dealing in equity shares rather than ownership, the property is held outside of the market, and the affordability created is recycled from one generation of occupants to the next.

The model creates a new way of owning equity in the value of residential property. Although relatively new, the model is tried and tested.
