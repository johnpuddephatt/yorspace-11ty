Since January 2017, YorSpace have been successful in attracting over £240,000 worth of grant funding. This seed funding has financed predevelopment works and the Planning phase of Lowfield Green.

We have secured grant money to cover the 15% deposit necessary to purchase the land, while the money raised from the share offer will be used to buy the land, cover fees and YorSpace’s development costs during the build phase.

We are in negotiations to secure an equity investment from the Community Shares Booster Programme for this offer. If successful, it would mean that for every pound invested by individuals up to £100,000, another pound will be invested in matched shares.
