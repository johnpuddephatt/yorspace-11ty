We secured grant money to cover the 15% deposit for purchasing the land. Our £475,000 share offer will raise the money to buy the land, cover fees and YorSpace’s development costs during the build phase.

We’ve secured the support of the Booster Programme – funded by Power to Change and run by the Community Shares Unit – meaning up to £100,000 is available to match applications for shares from the public. This means for every pound invested by individuals, another pound will be invested in shares by the Booster Programme, up to a maximum of £100,000.

Once our first development is complete, we’ll have an income stream that enables us to undertake further projects in York
