Since January 2017, YorSpace have been successful in attracting over £240,000 worth of grant funding. This seed funding has financed predevelopment works and the Planning phase of Lowfield Green.

We have secured grant money to cover the 15% deposit to purchase the land and will secure £100,000 worth of match funding from Power To Change upon receiving standard mark accreditation for our share offer. The money raised from the share offer will be used to buy the land, cover fees and YorSpace’s development costs during the build phase.
