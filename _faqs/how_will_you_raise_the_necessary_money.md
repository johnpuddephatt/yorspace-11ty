Since January 2017, YorSpace has attracted over £240,000 worth of grant funding. This has financed pre-development works and the planning phase of Lowfield Green.

We’ve secured grant money to cover the 15% deposit needed to purchase the land, with money raised from the share offer needed to buy the land, cover fees and YorSpace’s development costs during the build phase.

We’re in negotiations with the Community Shares Booster Programme to secure an equity investment which would mean that for every pound invested by individuals up to £100,000, another pound will be invested in matched shares.
