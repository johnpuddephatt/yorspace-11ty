One Planet Living is a sustainability framework used to design and shape YorSpace homes. It is different from other sustainability frameworks because:

- It puts people first – it’s grounded in the reality of how people live their lives rather than box ticking
- It’s holistic – nothing will drop through the gaps with the 10 principles
- It’s about true sustainability – there’s no greenwashing
- It reaches hearts as well as minds - One Planet Living is used to inspire people across the world to get involved in sustainable change.
