Investments can be withdrawn after three years.

To keep the organisation capitalised, the total share volume across all investors that can be withdrawn per year is limited to 5% of total share capital.

In a scenario where all investors chose to draw out their investment equally, withdrawal of all share interest (above capital) would take 33 years to complete.

To help potential investors understand how much they could withdraw per year in this scenario, we've created four forecasts based on different levels of investment. [You can view the forecasts here](/uploads/share-withdrawal-forecasts.xlsx).

In reality an individualâ€™s withdrawal rate may vary due to different investors withdrawing their capital at different rates.
