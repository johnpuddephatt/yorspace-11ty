           Sustainable by design
        </h2>
        <p>
          We’re looking to achieve high levels of sustainability by reusing and repurposing the existing building as much as possible, while still bringing in changes that improve efficiency.</p>




          <p>In particular, our aim is to:</p>


          <ul>
            <li>Retain most of the existing building structure</li>
            <li>Incorporate retrofit design features that allow the incorporation of renewable energy to power the building</li>
            <li>Improve thermal performance with low embodied carbon insulation materials </li>
            <li>Lower residents’ environmental footprint whilst saving them money</li>
            
          </ul>
