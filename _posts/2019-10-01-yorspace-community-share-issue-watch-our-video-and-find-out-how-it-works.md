We've been flat out at Yorspace throughout September, with the launch of our £475,000 Community Share Issue. The official launch event for investors took place at the National Centre for Early Music in York on the 19th September. See write up [here](http://social-vision.org.uk/lets-start-a-housing-revolution/).

This was nicely timed with the news that we've been awarded £100,000 of match funding from the [Power to Change Community Shares Booster Programme](https://www.powertochange.org.uk/get-support/programmes/community-shares/). Under this programme up to £100,000 is available to match applications for shares from the public. This means that for every pound invested by individuals up to £100,000, another pound will be invested in shares by the Booster Programme!

Our next Investor event will be on Thursday 17th October from 6.30 to 8.30 pm. Venue to be announced shortly. In the meantime, here's a great video (courtesy of Let's Dance Agency) of the launch, explaining how you can invest, and how you - and the people of York - can benefit.
