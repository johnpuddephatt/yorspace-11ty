We have a vision of revolutionising how housing is funded, delivered and owned in York - providing a tangible solution to the UK housing crisis..

YorSpace is passionate about changing how house building works and want to make it fairer, more accessible, better for the environment, focussed around the needs of the community and permanently affordable. 

We are using a community share offer to raise money for homes in the community and need YOU to invest to help make this happen. Come and be part of our housing revolution, make a return on your investment and have a stake in forever affordable housing.

Full details of the offer and a link to invest can be found here: <https://www.ethex.org.uk/YorSpace>
