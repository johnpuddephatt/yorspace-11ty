We are delighted to announce that the residents of Lowfield Green Co-op have appointed local firm [Croft Farm Construction](www.croftfarmconstruction.com/) as Preferred Partner for the development of their 19 permanently affordable homes at Lowfield Green, Acomb.  Croft Farm has a reputation in energy efficient Passivhaus building as well as having won national awards for renovation projects.  They were also the main contractor for the renovation of The Red Tower in York.

All the homes at Lowfield Green have been designed around One Planet Living principles of sustainable living, which will limit the environmental impact of the neighbourhood being built.  Every building is being built from low carbon, bio-based construction materials which lower the carbon footprint of the fabric of the homes whilst making them both energy efficient and economical to run.  The common house which will bring the community together for shared meals and also contain a launderette will be built out of locally sourced straw bales.

“It was very clear from our first meeting with Croft Farm that they share the values and vision of Lowfield Green Housing Co-op and YorSpace. We are incredibly excited about working with them to create homes that we know are going to be built with sustainability as an absolute priority”, comments Jonny Wells, resident at Lowfield Green.

Phil Gledall, director of Croft Farm says “I’m delighted to be appointed by Lowfield Green to build their sustainable, low carbon homes.  If we can do our bit to solve the housing crisis in York and provide a lasting legacy for others to follow that would be fantastic”.  

Meanwhile, our community share offer to raise the £475,000 is underway so that Yorspace can purchase the land. Full details of the share offer and the 2.5% return for investors is available via our Invest page on this website.
