We’re tickled pink to have been chosen by the [Cooperative Community Fund](https://www.coop.co.uk/membership/what-your-community-gets?utm_source=Coop.co.uk&utm_medium=relaunch_block&utm_campaign=value_to_community) as one of the local causes supported by their marvellous members’ reward scheme!

This means that Co-op shoppers who opt to become Co-op members are supporting local causes in their area by generating donations each time they shop at no extra cost to themselves.

It’s a brilliantly simple scheme and we’re honoured to be chosen to participate in this important fundraising opportunity which will support our first co-operatively owned housing development at Lowfield Green in York.

### We need your help

If you’re a Co-op shopper we’re calling on you to get behind our fundraising efforts by directing your donations our way. It’s a doddle to do it - here’s how:
