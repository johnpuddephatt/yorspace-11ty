After successive years of well documented global challenges combined with difficult funding landscapes, we are so excited to announce that 2024 will be THE year for our first scheme in York!

**The story so far…**

YorSpace has been working with City of York Council since 2016 to bring this ground-breaking development to fruition. Working with the Lowfield Green Housing Co-op resident group and key stakeholders we've been able to bring in the financial and professional resources needed to deliver this project against our three organisational aims: Affordability, Sustainablilty and Community-led.

This culminated in our first ever community share raise that closed in 2020, which involved more than 180 social investors who raised over £422,000 to take the project forward.

***Key milestones achieved to date:***

* Planning permission secured
* Land purchased from local authority
* Development grant & finance secured
* Contractor appointed

***Recent developments:***

We have confirmed our contract partners. [Purehaus](https://purehaus.co.uk/) are a Yorkshire based firm that specialises in building to Passivhaus standards and share our passion for education and the planet.

We have secured [grant funding](https://yorknorthyorks-ca.gov.uk/york-and-north-yorkshire-brownfield-housing-fund/) from the recently incorporated York & North Yorkshire Combined Mayoral Authority which will fund the enabling works to unlock the site for development.

We have recently taken receipt of the first raw materials to arrive on site.

We are closing in on finalising the capital borrowing required to build the first 14 of the planned 19 homes. Once this is secured, the development will move into the building phase planned to commence Spring 2024.

The first set of Lowfield Green Housing Co-op residents are expected to move in Spring 2025.
