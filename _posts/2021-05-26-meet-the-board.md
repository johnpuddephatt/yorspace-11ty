At the YorSpace AGM in April 2021 members voted to elect Directors to sit on the Board. Find out more about them here.

By the way, the Board still has room to grow and is inviting expressions of interest for the roles of Director or Treasurer. If you’d like to be part of the team steering YorSpace into the future contact us on [hello@yorpace.org](<mailto: hello@yorspace.org>) to find out how.

### \- Sue -

Sue co-founded YorSpace because she believes that houses should be built by the people who live in them and that this will create warm and thriving communities that will benefit everyone. She continues to work to bring Lowfield Green to completion which she hopes will be the first of many similar developments across York.

Sue is a biological scientist by profession and enjoys applying her skills in innovation and practical problem solving from the sciences to tackle the problems of community-led housing.

### \- Alex -

Alex’s interest in community-led housing and housing co-ops is long-held. Since working in Housing Advice in the early 1990s, he’s observed how the many positives of housing provision highly suited to - and co-created with - its occupants also benefit the wider local community.

Alex is now the Founder and MD at UK Hempcrete and is a leading expert in the use of hempcrete and other bio-materials in construction. He co-authored The Hempcrete Book (2014), a comprehensive guide for self-builders and architects on how to build houses with hempcrete and associated bio-based materials.

### \- James -

James is co-founder and Director of YorSpace and is looking forward to becoming a resident member of Lowfield Green Housing Co-op.

James is a freelance designer and a specialist in low carbon architecture and bio-based construction materials with experience in delivering a wide range of community and residential projects. James is organised, driven and a committed active YorSpace member - involved in several of the Lowfield Green working teams. Having accredited as a Community-Led Housing Enabler, James is also working with several other groups in the Yorkshire region building a strong knowledge base and network in the community-led housing sector.
