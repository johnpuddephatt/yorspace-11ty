“Bringing low carbon, affordable communities to York”

**Affordable, sustainable housing is hard to find in York. This is soon set to change as YorSpace, with a mission to tackle the ongoing housing crisis, launches its first low carbon, affordable housing development at Lowfield Green in Acomb.**

The YorSpace model offers residents a chance to buy homes at 75% of the market value and keeps the land in community hands forever. This means the homes will always be more affordable than similar sized properties in the city. The 19 low carbon homes will be built to Passivhaus standards, reducing co2 emissions and energy bills; making them affordable to run too.  

This month YorSpace is celebrating a key moment in delivering York’s first housing co-operative as work begins onsite this week to build the homes. Joining YorSpace were Lowfield Green Housing Co-op members who represent the future residents. 

**Sue of Lowfield Green Housing Co-op said,** 

*“This is such an exciting day for us to be here on site, where our future homes will be. We’ve been waiting for this day for a long time, 10 years for some members. I really want to live in this community, know who my neighbours are, share resources and do what we can to reduce our collective carbon footprint.”*

**James of YorSpace added,** 

> *“We’re really pleased to be moving onto this stage of the project when, at times, it’s felt like it might never happen. A core group of committed people who believed in trying to make a difference in York have persisted through many challenges. We have had a lot of support to get to this point today, not least our 180 social investors who helped us secure the land.”*

The **£4.5million project** has struggled with numerous challenges since 2020 when the pandemic landed, but is now able to move forward on site. 2023 proved to be a key year when YorSpace were able to find both grant funding and secure the development finance needed to start building. A grant from the Bnewly formed Brownfield Land Release Fund administered by the newly formed **York & North Yorkshire Combined Authority** has unlocked**Resonance Community Developers**,  a social impact property fund manager, will finance the project. 

YorSpace is working with Yorkshire-based building contractor partner **[Pure Haus](https://purehaus.co.uk/)** to develop the homes. A company who aligns perfectly with the YorSpace mission to bring about change in the housing industry; introducing low cost, low energy homes with low impact on the environment. 

Phase 1 of the development will see 14 homes across three terrace blocks with 2, 3 and 4-bed houses being built. These homes will have private gardens but the homes all face into a central car-free street with communal gardens and shared facilities, designed to bring the community together. 

*“How it works is that residents will own their own homes but everyone has chosen to live in the community as part of Lowfield Green Housing Co-operative. With an ethos centred around community, sustainability and affordability, the co-op believes it’s important to look at the way we live as well as the homes we live in. We don’t all need to own one of everything - lawnmowers, cars, tents etc can all be shared - helping us all to save money and work together to leave a lighter carbon footprint. By coming together in this project, no matter people’s age or background, we are tackling the issues of loneliness and isolation, promoting community, affordability of home ownership and reducing the environmental impact of our homes and lifestyles.”* - Sue
