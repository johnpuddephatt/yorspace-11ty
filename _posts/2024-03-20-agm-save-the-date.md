Our next YorSpace Annual General Meeting will take place on Saturday 18th May at The Gateway Centre, on Front Street, Acomb. 

Following recent member feedback, we have moved the meeting to the afternoon and for the first time we are making the session fully hybrid, to give all YorSpace members the opportunity to attend and participate in person or online. For those that choose to come along in person, the agenda will include a walk to the Lowfield Green site so you can see the development in progress for yourself. 

An official invite will be sent out nearer the date, please RSVP to confirm your attendance.
