"Anecdotal evidence and observation tells us that the housing sector is predominantly white, middle and upper class led.  If Community led Housing (CLH) wants to be more inclusive and diverse it has the opportunity to change things going forward, by ensuring Black and Minority Ethnic (BAME) people and other minorities like Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transexual and Queer (LGBTQ+) people and disabled people are central to the sector's aims and objectives at all levels. This includes groups on the ground right up to the staff and board rooms.
Positive action is needed in light of Black Lives Matters (BLM), COVID-19 and stories coming out of the Windrush generation, as housing is a core driver in creating equality. Community Land Trusts (CLTs) and the wider CLH movement can be the blueprint and pace setter in the new race of equal rights and justice for all ensuring the existing generation can live in a fairer world." 

Claude Hendrickson, BAME and diversity associate, Leeds Community Homes.
