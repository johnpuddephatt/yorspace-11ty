On 22nd April, YorSpace and York Community Energy  put on a joint event to talk about what community energy is and how creating community-owned renewable energy can part of a community-led housing project.

Hosted at [Clements Hall](http://www.clementshall.org.uk/) we had a great turn out and were pleased to have Carbon Co-op, LEDA & Lancaster Cohousing come along and share their expertise on delivering community owned power.

YorSpace and York Community Energy are keen to explore the possibility of delivering community energy in York and see Lowfield Green as a potential site for the cityâ€™s first community owned housing.

More details can be found on the [York Community Energy website](http://yorkcommunityenergy.org.uk/expert-views-on-community-energy-and-lowfield-green/) where Rich Lane has done a great write up with details of the day in the link below.
