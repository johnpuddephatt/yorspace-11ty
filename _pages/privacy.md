Policy written & approved by Directors May 2018

YorSpace confidentiality and data protection policy

YorSpace works to maintain standards of confidentiality and data protection in relation to personal information and / or detailed information about YorSpace's work or activities.

There are two current Acts / regulations and three pending introduction that primarily regulate YorSpace and data protection.

These are:

- Data Protection Act (DPA) 1998
- Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations (PECR) 2003
- Data Protection Bill -- currently before parliament
- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 2018
- ePrivacy regulations 2018

YorSpace's policy is to comply with the latest data protection regulations and law and best practice. In addition it requires potential employees, volunteers and third party suppliers to cooperate with YorSpace in order to comply.

This policy applies to all volunteer, potential staff, contractors and those working for YorSpace, whether permanent or temporary. It must be read and agreed to before access to any information is provided.

Volunteers, including Directors who have access to Personal Identifying Information or detailed information about YorSpace's work or activities must also read and agree to this policy. This  includes the Confidentiality statement form

Volunteers who do not have access to Personal Identifying Information or detailed information about YorSpace's activities must sign and agree to the confidentiality statement, in the likelihood they may come into contact with personal identifying information.

This policy applies to information about identifiable individuals. This applies even where information is technically outside the scope of the Acts or regulations, by not meeting the strict definition of 'data' in the Act or regulation.

YorSpace will:

- comply with both the law and good practice
- respect individuals' rights
- be open and honest with individuals whose data is held

YorSpace recognises that its first priority under the Data Protection Act is to avoid causing harm to individuals.  In the main this means:

- keeping information securely in the right hands, and
- keeping good quality information.

The Act also aims to make sure that the legitimate concerns of individuals about the ways in which their data may be used are taken into account.

YorSpace will:

- be open and transparent
- seek to give individuals as much choice as is possible and reasonable over what data is held and how it is used.

The responsibility for observing these standards applies to every Director, volunteer and potential member of staff and any third party allowed access to personal information.

Third parties must comply with the requirements of the Data Protection Act and or GDPR in their handling of such information.

Breaches of this policy by Directors, volunteers and potential members of staff and volunteers may be considered a serious disciplinary matter.

Individuals may also be held criminally liable for knowingly or recklessly disclosing personal data outside of these policies and procedures.

Breaches on the part of third parties will be considered breach of contract.

YorSpace's privacy policy explains how we capture, store and use the personal data of people of our stakeholders. This includes how we meet the legal requirements of the Data Protection Act, GDPR and the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations, the Data Protection Bill and the ePrivacy regulations.

We may also receive information about you from third parties for a specific purpose. However, this will only happen if you have given them permission to share your information.

### Complying with the Data Protection Act

Data Protection Act principles require YorSpace to process personal data fairly and lawfully. We will offer you choices about the way you are contacted. We will also be clear about how we will use your information. We will make sure that the reason for collecting information is lawful.

We only hold data about you that is enough for our purpose, nothing more.
